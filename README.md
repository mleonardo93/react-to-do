A React-based to-do app made with Create React App. 
I got a refresher on components, props, and state, and learned how to use event listeners to change the model and reflect changes in the view.
I learned how to use forms and events to add new data to the app and reflect the new data in the view.
I learned how to use JavaScript's `filter` method to remove things from arrays.
